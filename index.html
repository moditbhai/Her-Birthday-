      Today is the most special day because someone incredibly special was born – YOU! 💖<br><br>
      Your smile lights up my world, your laughter is my favorite melody, and your love is the most precious gift I could ever ask for. On your birthday, I just want to say how lucky I am to have you. Here's to all the love, adventures, and memories we're yet to create. 💫
